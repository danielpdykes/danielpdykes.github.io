Inking the deal at the start of 2016, Emotient will allow Apple to achieve something seemingly magical: it’ll allow Apple hardware, with Siri as the potential UI, to interpret the 43 muscles in your face. And from those, it’ll be able to work out who you are and what you’re feeling.</p><blockquote><p>Emotient is the leading authority on facial expression recognition and analysis technologies that are enabling a future of emotion aware computing.</p></blockquote><p>Apple have bought heavily into this space of late. The application for home control is obvious: its killer app. Emotient’s technology could figure into the rumoured Amazon Echo killer, and it could also come to power new iOS APIs.</p><p>It could also power entirely new categories for the company beyond home control.
